### Some things to consider when designing
* Have selected item bubble to top?
* Have separator after bubbled item?
* Have selected item in bold?
* Have background color in selected item?
* On mobile, should clicking on the dropdown open a dropdown or a full screen scrollable list?
* Positioning - below or over emitting element? if over, then dynamic or aligned to top of emitting element?
